This is basically the same program as that contained
in the slffea-1.0/truss/truss/ directory.  The main 
difference is that it prints out more data and is not
dependent on the slffea-1.0/common/ directory for
certain utility files like matrix multiplication
and skyline. 

When you run "make", the executable you
create is called "ft".  If you are working
with a SUN, you might want to try uncommenting:

#CC = /usr/lang/acc  -g

and commenting out:

CC = /usr/bin/gcc  -g

"outp4_11.txt" has the output
you should get if you run the data set "tsp4_11.txt".

The best way to determine whether a member is in
tension or compression is to look at the stresses in
the *.str.ots files.  If the value of the stress is
positive, then the member is in tension.  Additionally,
from the output of the axial displacement, if you see
that displacement(node 2nd - node 1st) > 0, then there is
tension in the member.
