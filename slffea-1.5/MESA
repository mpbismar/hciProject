Here are instructions to install Mesa taken from my GNU/Linux FAQ:

16.0.0 Installing Mesa(the OpenGL graphics library):


   16.1.0  For  recent  versions  of  GNU/Linux(like  Slack­
           ware-7.1), Mesa comes pre-installed.  All you need to do is  add  the
           following softlink:  

                 cd /usr/include/
                 ln -s /usr/X11R6/include/GL/ GL

           if it doesn't already exist.

           If  you  are  running Redhat, you need to add the glut libraries from
           the RPMs on the installation disk(For RedHat 8.0, it is  on  the  3rd
           disk, for RedHat 9.0, it is on the 2nd disk):

                 cd /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS
                 rpm -Uhv  glut-3.7-12.i386.rpm
                 rpm -Uhv  glut-devel-3.7-12.i386.rpm

           There  are several places where you can get Mesa.  You can get it off
           the web at:

      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3&release_id=40500


   16.2.0  After getting the  tarfiles,  copy  them  to  the
           directory /usr/local/ and do:

                 tar xzvfp MesaLib*.gz
                 tar xzvfp MesaDemos*.gz


   16.3.0  Compiling Mesa Programs


        16.3.1 From the /Mesa-3.4.2/README:


                    To  compile  the library, first type 'make' alone to see the
                    list of system configurations currently supported.   If  you
                    see  your  configuration  on the list, type 'make <config>'.
                    Most popular Unix/X workstations are currently supported.

               For my machine, I use:

                    make linux


        16.3.2 Header Files and Libraries

               From the /Mesa-3.4.2/docs/INSTALL:


                    Header and library files:
                       After you've compiled Mesa and tried the demos I recommend the following
                       procedure for "installing" Mesa.

                       Copy the Mesa include/GL directory to /usr/local/include:


                     mkdir /usr/local/include/GL
                     cp -r include/GL/* /usr/local/include/GL/


                       Copy the Mesa library files to /usr/local/lib:


                        cp -d lib/* /usr/local/lib



                            (actually, use "cp -d" on Linux to preserve symbolic
                    links)


        16.3.3 Install Widgets-Mesa Library

               You also need to install the Widgets-Mesa Library.  First:

                     cd  /usr/local/Mesa-3.4.2/widgets-mesa/

               The file /usr/local/Mesa-3.4.2/widgets-mesa/INSTALL tells you to:


                        ./configure
                        make
                        make demo.gl
                        make demo.mesa
                        make demo.ws
                        make demo.tea
                        make install
