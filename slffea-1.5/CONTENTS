10 Graphical User Interfaces for each element type.


Naming Conventions:
------------------

There are 9 directories corresponding to the 9 basic element types.  Within
each are at least 2 directories: one which contains the source for the
basic element type and one for the GUI associated with that element.  All
GUI directories have a "_gr" extension.  For instance, in the slffea-1.5/plate/
directory, there is the plate and plate_gr directories. 

There are 2 common directories, one for the common scientific functions and
one for the common graphics functions.

The names of the source files adhere to the following naming conventions:
