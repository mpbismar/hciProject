Those who have found my software useful may want to consider making a
donation of money to:

Lanh Le
9150 Todos Santos
Santee, CA 92071
USA

and write all checks to "Lanh Le." Donate what you feel is appropriate,
but if you want a recommendation regarding amount, then I would suggest
$25.00 for individuals and $100.00 if you represent a company and are
using it on multiple machines.
