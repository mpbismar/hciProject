The data directory for the brick codes, slffea-1.0/data/br/, contain both
linear and non-linear data files.  Although the file format for both is
the same, the loads for the files, "b1", "nsquash", "patch", "tensile", and "torsion"
are large enough to cause non-linear large deformation.  So you have to decrease
the loads if you want to do linear analysis.  The files "ball" and "rubber"
are for linear analysis.
