You can do either plane stress or plane strain analysis.  For plane stress,
set the plane_stress_flag in your input file to 1.  For plane strain, set
it to 0.

I once considered merging the triangle element together with the wedge because
I could have coded the wedge so that it would read in the 3 nodes of a
triangle and treat the second set of wedge nodes on top as nodes parallel to
the first 3.  But it is fortunate that I did not because I modified the triangle
code so that it could also solve for 3-D 3 node membrane elements.  This may
have been complicated in terms of adding this capacity to the wedge.  I say more
about this modification below.

3-D 3 Node Triangular Membrane Elements

In October 2005, I added code to make the 2-D triangle element into a 3-D
element.  This meant adding rotations between 3-D global coordinates and 2-D
local coordinates.  The 2-D coordinates are similar to the lamina part of the
shell.  Because there are no rotational DOFs, this element is essentially a
membrane which can only support loads in its local planer coordinates.  This
can be considered analogous to the relationship between a 3-D beam(shell) and a
truss(3-D plane stress/plane strain element).  The main implications are that
you have to be very careful about singular input meshes which can occur when
there are co-linear elements.  For these types of situations, you will either
have to fix displacements in enough directions to remove the singularities, or
add a non-co-linear element at nodes where the co-linear elements are joined.

A good illustration of the need for care in dealing with this element's membrane 
limitations can be seen in the need for 3 different patch test meshes for
each x, y, and z direction.  Here are the comments at the top of trpatch.c:

    There are 3 output patch test files: patch.x, patch.y, and patch.z.
    This triangle element is like the truss element in that it can not
    handle loads perpendicular to the local plane of an element because
    it is simply a membrane.  I had tried to do a mesh which had x, y, and
    z components with displacements co-linear with the plane, but the
    results showed that this was not a valid analysis.  You can see this
    by taking a single element in the global x-y plane and leaving one node
    completely free.  Even if you put a load with only x-y components, the
    global stiffness will still be singular because the z DOF needs to be
    fixed.  If the calculation does not blow up, it will still produce
    incorrect results.  This is why the patch test needs to be broken down
    into 3 meshes with only 2 DOFs on the free center node corresponding to
    the plane of the mesh for each patch.

I also had singularity trouble with the trbubble2 mesh which was a hemisphere with
a small opening at the top.  I had to close this opening by adding additional
non-co-linear elements.  Interestingly, the problem of singularity only revealed
itself when I did modal analysis.  At the bottom of the trbubble2 file, I say:

  This mesh was singular until I added elements 400-410 and node 210.  I also had
  to place node 210 at (0.0, 0.0, 9.8) because if it were at (0.0, 0.0, 10.0) then
  all the elements:

     400       200     201    210         0
     401       201     202    210         0
     402       202     203    210         0
     403       203     204    210         0
     404       204     205    210         0
     405       205     206    210         0
     406       206     207    210         0
     407       207     208    210         0
     408       208     209    210         0
     409       209     200    210         0

  would be on the same plane.  Even putting 210 at an elevation of (0.0, 0.0, 10.1) would
  not be enough.  Note that the mesh trbubble does not have to be modified like this.  I did
  a similar modification with tsbubble2.
